// An array of car automobile companies
const cars = ["Rivian", "Jeep", "Ford"];
// Arrays are a much more efficient way to create variables
// What if you had 300 different cars? Arrays, baby.

// It's ok to create arrays on multiple lines as well:
const popsicle = [
    "Mango",
    "Strawberry"
    "Watermelon"
];
